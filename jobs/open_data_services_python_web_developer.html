        <h1>Company&nbsp;overview</h1>
<p>Open Data Services is a new and growing workers co-operative. We deliver sustainable support for world-changing open data projects, including the Open Contracting Data Standard, the 360Giving open philanthropy initiative, the International Aid Transparency Initiative (<span class="caps">IATI</span>) and Open&nbsp;Referral. </p>
<p>We’re an interdisciplinary team, combining developers, analysts and researchers working to create tools and services that help organisations publish and use open data for social&nbsp;change. </p>
<p>Since we started in 2015 we’ve grown from 4 to 9 co-operative members based across the <span class="caps">UK</span>, providing family friendly and flexible working. We’re seeking to create a great place to work whilst contributing to open data impacts across the&nbsp;world. </p>
<p>We welcome applications from underrepresented minorities, and we value diversity within our workforce. If we can do anything to facilitate your application, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p>
<p>All employees are eligible to become co-operative members, taking an equal stake in the future development of our&nbsp;work.</p>
<h1>Job&nbsp;overview</h1>
<p><em>We’re looking a python web developer or data scientist to join our small co-operative team: working on projects that use open data for social&nbsp;change.</em></p>
<p><strong>Apply by 9am Monday 26th September&nbsp;2016.</strong></p>
<p>You&nbsp;will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get involved in ongoing development of data standards, and data standard extensions, for Open Contracting (<span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema) and <span class="caps">IATI</span> (<span class="caps">XML</span> Schema), including through regular engagement with growing user&nbsp;communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help us to build and maintain open source software that unlocks the social and political impacts of open&nbsp;data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work as part of the development team to deliver both stable products and rapid prototypes for our partners, and to support key open data&nbsp;standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get involved in planning, deploying and testing code and user&nbsp;experience;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get involved in the wider work of the co-operative, supporting communities and organisations across the world to understand open data, to publish data using open standards, and to reuse data in accessible, user-centred tools and&nbsp;services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a strong commitment to free and open source software, rooted in our co-operative&nbsp;ethics.</p>
<p>A great candidate will&nbsp;be:</p>

<p>We’re a distributed team, so you will mostly be remote/home working, with opportunities to travel locally and internationally to work with partners, and for regular team meetings and&nbsp;co-working.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A lifelong learner</strong> — excited about the opportunity to be part of building an emerging co-operative, working in a rapidly developing field, and building on and contributing to emerging open&nbsp;technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A team player</strong> — familiar with many of the technologies we already use, and ready to learn the others. An understanding of the open data landscape and data standards will be helpful, as would experience working on small-to-medium sized collaborative software&nbsp;projects. </p>

<h1>Contractual&nbsp;details</h1>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Closing date for applications is 9am Monday 26th September&nbsp;2016.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> We’re a <span class="caps">UK</span>-based distributed team and all work from home, with regular team meetings and co-working, often in Birmingham. Current team members are located in or near Manchester, Leeds, London, Stroud, Nottingham and&nbsp;Cambridge. </p>
<p>You must have the right to live and work in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. </p>
<p><strong>Remuneration <span class="amp">&amp;</span> benefits:</strong> As a collectively managed and owned co-operative, we operate a flat rate of pay for all staff. This is currently set at <strong>£34,500 p.a</strong>., with a planned rise over 2016 towards £36,000, subject to company&nbsp;performance. </p>
<p>All employees, that have passed a successful probationary period, are entitled to become members. Each member is an equal owner of the business, and all members have an equal vote in decision&nbsp;making.</p>
<p>Members are able to vote on profit distributions at the end of each year, part of which can be as a dividend to members. In the last year, we also voted on making contributions to a number of open source projects, and to the Open Rights&nbsp;Group.</p>
<p>Open Data Services operates an auto enrollment pension scheme with 3% employer contributions. If you have an existing pension scheme, we may be able to make contributions to that. Our policy is to progressively improve employee benefits as the co-operative develops, with all co-operative members having an equal right to vote on benefits, dividends, and&nbsp;bonuses. </p>
<p>We operate a Bring Your Own Device (<span class="caps">BYOD</span>) policy and provide the online tools and software you need for your job. If you don’t already have a home working set-up, or need to find local co-working space, we’ll help to get that all&nbsp;set-up. </p>
<p>We offer salary sacrifice Childcarescheme vouchers that allow employees to reduce their childcare&nbsp;costs.</p>
<p><strong>Hours and holiday:</strong> Full time hours are set at 37.5 hours a week with 33 days holiday a year (including bank holidays). We will consider applications for part-time working of 0.5 <span class="caps">FTE</span> and&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>We offer flexible working negotiated on the needs of our staff and the co-operative. This means we are able to offer family friendly, part-time, and job share roles. We are also committed to making reasonable adjustments to enable people to do their&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Within reasonable limits we operate a flexi-time policy. We have a short team call each morning to plan work for the day which we expect everyone to try and join - and then each set our schedules accordingly, striving for a good work-life&nbsp;balance. </p>
<p>This role will involve calls and meetings with international partners, which may require occasional early morning, late evening or weekend&nbsp;working.</p>
<p><strong>Travel:</strong> You must be willing to travel regularly within the <span class="caps">UK</span>, and to undertake occasional international&nbsp;travel. </p>
<h1>Application</h1>
<p>To apply, please send your <span class="caps">CV</span> (no more than three pages) and a covering letter (no more than 2 pages) to <a href="mailto:jobs@opendataservices.coop">jobs@opendataservices.coop</a>  </p>
<p>Your covering letter should include the date you will be available to&nbsp;start. </p>
<p>Please indicate in your covering letter if we can also keep your <span class="caps">CV</span> on file for future&nbsp;opportunities. </p>
<p>Closing date for applications is 9am Monday 26th September&nbsp;2016.</p>
<p>We will shortlist applicants for interview during the week commencing 26th September, and conduct a first round of phone interviews in the w/c 10th&nbsp;October. </p>
<p>A second round of face to face interviews will be held in the w/c 17th October. The times and locations will be agreed with applicants as&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<h1>More about Open Data Services - Working as a&nbsp;co-operative</h1>
<p>As a workers co-operative we operate as a values-driven business. We are building for the long-term: we are not controlled by shareholders seeking short-term gain. We operate in-line with global co-operative principles, and part of a global movement of&nbsp;co-operators. </p>
<p>Being a workers co-operative is also an experiment. We believe that much open data is a public good, and to sustain public goods we need strong foundations. We believe that co-operative models are an important part of&nbsp;that. </p>
<p>After a short probationary period, all employees are eligible to become a member of the co-operative, taking on an equal role in the ownership and governance of the business. We operate collective management, with regular online team meetings, and quarterly full-team meet-ups to make decisions about the projects, operations and direction of our shared&nbsp;work. </p>
<p>(Co-operative membership is optional. There is no obligation for employees to become a member, and all core employment benefits are shared equally amongst the team, whether members or&nbsp;not.)</p>    </div>
