        <p><em>Closes 19th&nbsp;February.</em></p>
<p><strong>Open Data Services is a growing workers co-operative.</strong> We deliver sustainable support for world-changing open data projects, including the Open Contracting Data Standard, the 360Giving open philanthropy initiative and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (<span class="caps">IATI</span>).  </p>
<p>We’re an interdisciplinary team, with developers, analysts and researchers working together to create sustainable tools and services that help organisations publish and use open data for social&nbsp;change.  </p>
<p>Since we started in 2015 we’ve grown from 4 to 15 members of staff based across the <span class="caps">UK</span>, providing family-friendly and flexible working. We’re creating a great place to work, whilst contributing to open data impacts across the&nbsp;world.  </p>
<p><strong>We’re now seeking a new person to help develop software as part of projects that use open data for social change.<br />
</strong><br />
We welcome applications from underrepresented minorities, and we value diversity within our workforce. If we can do anything to facilitate your application, please get in&nbsp;touch.  </p>
<p>All employees are eligible to become co-operative members, taking an equal stake in the future development of our&nbsp;work.  </p>
<p>New to co-ops? <a href="https://www.uk.coop/developing-co-ops/grow-your-co-op/codes-governance/worker-co-operative-code">The Workers Co-operative Code</a> provides more information about what makes a worker co-op different. We started with a collective structure, and this year have been exploring aspects of a self-managing team&nbsp;model.  </p>
<h2>Is this&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>We’re looking for a data systems developer to join our small co-operative&nbsp;team.  </p>
<p>You&nbsp;will:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build and maintain open source tools</strong> to help with the preparation, publication, processing and application of open data to unlock its social and political&nbsp;potential;</li>
<li><strong>Develop and maintain data standards</strong>, and data standard extensions, for a range of data standards, including Open Contracting <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 360Giving (<span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema) and <span class="caps">IATI</span> (<span class="caps">XML</span>&nbsp;Schema);</li>
<li><strong>Work as part of the development team</strong> to deliver both stable products and rapid prototypes for our partners, and to support key open data&nbsp;standards;</li>
<li><strong>Engage with growing user communities</strong> around data&nbsp;standards;</li>
<li>Get involved in <strong>planning, deploying and testing</strong> code and user&nbsp;experience;</li>
<li><strong>Get involved in the wider work of the co-operative</strong>, supporting communities and organisations across the world to understand open data, to publish data using open standards, and to reuse data in accessible, user-centred tools and&nbsp;services</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a strong commitment to free and open source software, rooted in our co-operative&nbsp;ethics.  </p>
<p>A great candidate will&nbsp;be:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proactive, motivated and engaged</strong> — ready to work independently and as part of a team, prioritising and managing a varied workload, and committed to working on short and long-term projects with a social&nbsp;impact.  </p>
<p>We’re a distributed team, so you will mostly be remote/home working, with opportunities to travel locally and internationally to work with partners, and for regular team meetings and&nbsp;co-working.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A team player</strong> — excited about the opportunity to be part of building an emerging co-operative, working in a rapidly developing field, and building on and contributing to emerging open&nbsp;technologies.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>A lifelong learner</strong> — familiar with many of the technologies we already use, and ready to learn the others. An understanding of the open data landscape and data standards will be helpful, as would experience working on small-to-medium sized collaborative software&nbsp;projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<p>The core of this role will involve planning, developing and maintaining applications that work with open datasets in a range of formats and standards, and working on the ongoing technical development of those&nbsp;standards.  </p>
<p>There are opportunities within this role to get involved in a number of short-term research and development projects: where we help partners to understand the potential of open data through workshops, collaborative work and&nbsp;code.  </p>
<p>On a day-to-day basis you will&nbsp;be:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Writing&nbsp;code;</li>
<li>Reporting and responding to issues and fixing&nbsp;bugs;</li>
<li>Deploying software to live, staging and development&nbsp;environments;</li>
<li>Attending daily stand up meetings to prioritise work for the&nbsp;day;</li>
<li>Contributing to software development&nbsp;roadmaps;</li>
<li>Prioritising feature&nbsp;development;</li>
<li>Clarifying tasks within the team and with&nbsp;clients;</li>
<li>Working on updates to data standards and&nbsp;schema;</li>
<li>Monitoring the use of software, using a variety of&nbsp;tools;</li>
<li>Contributing to team meetings and the growth of the&nbsp;co-operative;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the main technologies we currently work with&nbsp;include:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data formats:</strong> <span class="caps">JSON</span>, Spreadsheets (including <span class="caps">CSV</span>), <span class="caps">XML</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Programming language <span class="amp">&amp;</span> frameworks</strong>: Python; Django; Javascript; Bash&nbsp;scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong>:&nbsp;Git</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong>: Linux; SaltStack; Apache; uwsgi; Server monitoring with Icinga (nagios&nbsp;fork)</li>
<li><strong>Testing and Continuous Integration</strong>: py.test, selenium and Travis <span class="caps">CI</span></li>
<li><strong>Database technologies</strong>: Elasticsearch, Relational databases behind Django’s <span class="caps">ORM</span></li>
<li><strong>Documentation formats</strong>: Markdown;&nbsp;ReStructuredText</li>
</ul>
<p>We practice agile software development, and work in the open through public issue trackers for many of our&nbsp;projects.  </p>
<h3>Values</h3>
<p>We believe in transparency, openness, kindness and co-operation. We recognise that these values can look very different in different people, and we’re working to avoid creating a monoculture. As a small organisation, each new person shapes the culture. If you share our values, we’ll make sure you fit&nbsp;in.  </p>
<p>You will be joining a team whose backgrounds include software development, physics, philosophy, youth work and business analysis. We recognise the value that diverse backgrounds and experience bring to the&nbsp;co-operative.  </p>
<h3>Skills and&nbsp;experience</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re passionate about how people develop new skills. We welcome people from a diversity of experiences and working&nbsp;history.  </p>
<p>We recognise that there are many paths to becoming a competent software developer. We are more interested in demonstrable skills and experience than in qualifications, but if you have them we&#8217;d like to hear about&nbsp;them.  </p>
<p>With that in mind, we’re looking for the following <strong>essential</strong> skills, knowledge, and&nbsp;experience:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Experience developing complex data structures and&nbsp;algorithms;</li>
<li>Experience of developing in Python or a similar&nbsp;language;</li>
<li>Data manipulation and&nbsp;management;</li>
<li>Use of version control tools to manage collaborative&nbsp;development;</li>
<li>Understanding of open&nbsp;source;</li>
<li>Ability to work as part of a diverse team: including interacting with&nbsp;clients;</li>
<li>Strong communication skills: ability to communicate via email, video calls, ticketing systems, and collaborative&nbsp;documents.</li>
<li>Ability to communicate one to one, in small groups, and meetings and via&nbsp;presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following skills and experience are <strong>desirable</strong>. Tell us about any you can bring to the team in your&nbsp;application.:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Experience working with a large number of the current technologies we work&nbsp;with;</li>
<li>Experience of working with or providing APIs and/or working with a data&nbsp;standard;</li>
<li>Experience of software testing and deployment and systems&nbsp;administration;</li>
<li>Experience of communicating with software users about bugs, upgrades, changes to&nbsp;code;</li>
<li>Experience with multiple programming&nbsp;languages;</li>
<li>Prior knowledge of the open data movement and community and/or understanding of open source software and content&nbsp;licensing;</li>
<li>A demonstrated commitment to co-operative&nbsp;values;</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re also interested in any other skills or experience that you think would contribute to the life and development of the&nbsp;co-operative.  </p>
<h2>Contractual&nbsp;details</h2>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> We’re a <span class="caps">UK</span>-based distributed team and all work remotely, either from home or co-working spaces around the country. We have regular team meetings and co-working, often in Birmingham, Manchester and London. Current team members are located in or near Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, London, Stroud, Nottingham, Cambridge, Newcastle, Edinburgh and&nbsp;Belfast.  </p>
<p>You must have the right to live and work in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.  </p>
<p><strong>Remuneration <span class="amp">&amp;</span> benefits:</strong> As a collectively run and owned co-operative, we operate a flat rate of pay for all staff. This is currently set at £37,008&nbsp;p.a.  </p>
<p>Open Data Services operates an auto enrollment pension scheme with 3% employer contributions. If you have an existing pension scheme, we may be able to make contributions to that. Our policy is to progressively improve employee benefits as the co-operative develops, with all co-operative members having an equal right to vote on benefits, dividends, and&nbsp;bonuses.  </p>
<p>All employees, that have passed a successful probationary period, are entitled to become members. Each member is an equal owner of the business, and all members have an equal vote in&nbsp;decision-making.  </p>
<p>Members are able to vote on profit distributions at the end of each year, part of which can be as a bonus to members. In the last year, we also voted on making contributions to a number of charities, open source projects, and to the Open Rights&nbsp;Group.  </p>
<p>Training and development is encouraged with all employees allocated an equal individual training budget, set by the&nbsp;members.  </p>
<p>We operate a Bring Your Own Device (<span class="caps">BYOD</span>) policy and provide the online tools and software you need for your job. If you don’t already have a home working set-up, or need to find local co-working space, we’ll help to get that all set-up, and cover the initial and ongoing&nbsp;costs.  </p>
<p>We offer salary sacrifice Childcare scheme vouchers that allow employees to reduce their childcare&nbsp;costs.  </p>
<p><strong>Hours and holiday:</strong> We welcome opportunities to work out a flexible and family friendly schedule with you. Full time hours are set at 37.5 hours a week with 33 days holiday a year (including bank&nbsp;holidays).  </p>
<p>Within reasonable limits we operate a flexi-time policy. We have a short team call each morning to plan work for the day which we expect everyone to try and join - and then each set our schedules accordingly, striving for a good work-life balance. We are also committed to making reasonable adjustments to enable people to do their&nbsp;work</p>    </div>
